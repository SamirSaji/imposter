# Imposter Finder

A fun party game to play with friends - find out who doesn't know the secret word!

## Why?
Built this because other imposter games have annoying ads and their "random" selection always picks someone in the middle. This one uses **cryptographically secure randomness** - truly fair for everyone.

## How to Play
1. Select number of players (3-10)
2. Pass the phone around - each player taps to see their word (or "IMPOSTER" if they're it)
3. Discuss! Ask questions about the word to find who's faking it
4. Vote out who you think is the imposter
5. Reveal and see if you were right!

## Features
- **No ads** - just the game
- **True random** - uses crypto API, not biased Math.random()
- **Mobile-first** - works great on phones
- **1000 words** - animals, food, places, and more
- **Scales imposters** - 1 for small groups, up to 3 for larger games

## Run It
Just open `index.html` in any browser. No install needed.
